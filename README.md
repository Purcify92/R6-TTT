# R6-TTT
 R6-TTT is a discord bot designed to make Trouble in Terrorist Town a reality in Rainbox Six Siege.
# What is Trouble in Terrorist Town
 Trouble in Terrorist Town (TTT) is a popular gamemode in Garry's Mod where players are randomly assigned as either innocent, detective, or traitor. The traitors must work together to eliminate the other players while trying to avoid being identified, while the innocent players must try their best to not die and help the detectives find the terrorists while the detectives must figure out who the terrorists are and eliminate them.
# How does the bot work?
 Well firstly, someone (The Host) must start the game using the /startgame command and specifying how many players are in the match. Then the bot will provide The Host with a Round ID, the players (including the host) can then use this Round ID to join the game using the /joingame command. Once everyone has joined the bot will then DM everybody their roles.
